# Magic Miro on Mars

## What is this
This repository contains an adaptation of the great board game "Magic Maze on Mars" for the digital whiteboard Miro. Using this Miro board the game can be played remotely with up to 6 players in the Browser (or the Miro Desktop App).

Original board game "Magic Maze On Mars": Author: Kasper Lapp / Publisher: Sit Down!
Author and publisher gave their friendly permission to play and their this template non-commercially amonst the Agile community.
See the actual Miro board for details about that permission.

## How to use
- The only file of this repository that you need is "Magic Miro on Mars.rtb". It is a backup of a Miro board.
- You need a Miro account and the rights to import Miro backups.
- In the main menu of Miro, click "Upload from backup" and upload "Magic Miro on Mars.rtb".
- The board should now be available in your Miro account.

## How to play
- It's sufficient that only one person has a Miro license. All other players can be guests without an Miro account.
- You have to know the rules of play of the original board game "Magic Maze on Mars".
- Until now I wasn't able to describe the handling in Miro. *This means that you probably need a personal introduction by Udo or by someone who already participated in an online play session.* Maybe I add a description later

## Support the board game
The original board game "Magic Maze on Mars" is really great. Please consider buying a copy. It's totally worth it.
